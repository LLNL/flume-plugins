LDMS Hbase Sink Plugins

Presently supporting

/tmp/ldms/store/node/meminfo
/tmp/ldms/store/node/procstatutil
/tmp/ldms/store/node/sysclassib

Row keys are presently defined as

ldms-<sourcetype>-<clustername>-<timestamp>-<hostname>

where sourcetype would be an identifier for the LDMS source, such as
"meminfo".

The source would be configured like so (using ldms meminfo as an example):

a1.sources.r1.type = exec
a1.sources.r1.command = tail -F /tmp/ldms/store/node/meminfo
a1.sources.r1.channels = c1
a1.sources.r1.interceptors = i1 i2
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.type = static
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.key = clustername
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i1.value = <the cluster name>
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.type = static
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.key = sourcetype
a1.sources.r1.interceptors.i2.value = <ldms sourcetype>

and the sink would be configured as (again, using meminfo as an example)

a1.sinks.k1.type = hbase
a1.sinks.k1.channel = c1
a1.sinks.k1.table = <your table name>
a1.sinks.k1.columnFamily = <your column family>
a1.sinks.k1.serializer = org.apache.flume.sink.hbase.LdmsMeminfoHbaseEventSerializer

remember that the table name and column family must be configured in
Hbase before hand, such as with something like the following in the
Hbase shell.

create 'mytable', {NAME => 'columnfamily1'}, {NAME => 'columnfamily2'}
